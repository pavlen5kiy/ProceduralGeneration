# Procedural generation using Perlin noise
## About
HTML page that uses JavaScript generation script. Run python file to see the page at your localhost.

## How it works
This little project was inspired by Minecraft procedural world generation mechanics.  
The program uses three maps: terrain, temperature and moisture. The maps are being created as Perlin noise every time you load the page. These maps together then form all the bioms.

## Controls
**WASD** - move the map  
**]** - zoom in  
**[** - zoom out
